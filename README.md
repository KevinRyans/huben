# huben

This repository contains the frontend for **HUBen**, a platform that helps SMBs monitor whether company e‑mails are involved in known breaches. The UI is built with React, Vite and Tailwind CSS and includes multiple pages:

- **Hjem** – introduksjon og enkel søk etter lekkede e‑poster
- **Priser** – oversikt over abonnement
- **Bedriftspanel** – dashboard for kunder med lisens
- **Adminpanel** – administrative verktøy (placeholder)

The application is structured with React Router and ready to be connected to an Express backend later.

## Getting started

```bash
cd cyberhub/huben-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

For a production build run:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
